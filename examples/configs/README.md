Molecule geometries and reference energies

Whenever the datasets were taken from a public source we merely link to the original dataset and provide `*.csv` files that indicate which subsets were used in our publication. The `*.csv` files consist of a single column containing the indices of the subsets within the original data.

Datasets that were created by us are given in the form of `*.xyz` files containing structural data (coordinates in Angstrom) and reference energies (in eV) in the comment line.  
 
- densities
  
	Structures used for the density comparisons in Fig. 5

- MOB-ML
	
	Structures used for transferability tests (Fig. 3 and Tab. 1)

- sGDML

	Structures used for training curves (Fig. 2)

- MB-pol
	
	Structures used to to create water-model (Tab. 2, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5(water))
